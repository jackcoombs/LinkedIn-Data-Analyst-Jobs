# LinkedIn Data Analyst Jobs

## Description
In the constantly evolving world of data analytics, it can be hard to keep up with what skills companies need their data analysts to know.

I wanted to find the most common skills required for data analysts in the Chicago area. I set up a process to automatically extract data from LinkedIn public job postings, and analyzed the results with Python.

## Project Info
This project searches public job data from LinkedIn using the following parameters:
-Keyword: Data Analyst 
-Location: Chicago, IL 
-Date Posted: Posted in past 24 hours 
-Area: Within 25 miles 
-Experience Level: Entry level

Once a day, data from the results are scraped using selenium, and formated into a pandas dataframe. This dataframe is exported as a csv and saved, and also appended to a BigQuery table. (See ETL.ipynb)

The BigQuery table is loaded intoa datafarme, where I then use pandas, matplotlib, and other packages to analyze the results. I look at the amount of new jobs per week, common job titles, common skills listed in the job descriptions, and plot the location of the jobs on a map. (See Analysis.ipynb)

## Challenges
An issue I ran into with the data extraction is that LinkedIn will eventually want you to sign in to continue viewing job postings. This happens while looping through each job link and extracting additional info. That is why rows towards the bottom of each days export may lack additional data. As of this latest update, this affects around 14% of the job links in the data.

## Potential Improvements
I'd like to introduce a BI tool to analyze this data. Additionally, I'd like to analyze word pairs in the job descriptions, instead of single words. This way terms like "power bi" will show up as one term instead of two.
