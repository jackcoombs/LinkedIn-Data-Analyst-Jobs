At Key we work as compassionate partners with individuals, families, case managers and other professionals to provide the level of support needed to improve the lives of the clients we serve.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;At Key Autism Services, all the autism treatment services we provide are guided by a common philosophy about the role of the family in a child's development. We strive to equip both the children and their families with necessary skills for strong, satisfying relationships with one another, because we know that learning happens best when it happens in the context of playful, reciprocal interactions with life partners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;We believe family is the foundation for a child's development. Family is the ever-present guiding force in a child's life from the first breath through all the growing-up years. Family doesn't close for the holidays, go on vacation or call it quits at five o'clock. Family remains a persistent presence on a day-in, day-out basis, through all the seasons of the year, through all the years of childhood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Our team is committed to helping individuals and their families become self-sufficient and live as independently as their abilities allow. We hire compassionate, highly trained and dedicated individuals who show a passion to contribute their skills to make our client healthier and stronger.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out more opportunities we have to offer! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;https://www.keyautismservices.com/careers/",PART_TIME,Mental Health Care,41.7488,-87.76074,,,,,,,
