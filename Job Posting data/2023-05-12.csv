Our client hope to build the first of many sustainable DAOs. No blockchain has figured this out. The world-wide web was supposed to be decentralized, but is now more centralized than ever before. Without governance and cultural considerations, technologies are easily abused and used in ways absolutely antithetical to the design intent over time. Their techno-social solution addresses the problem of what it would take to actually create a decentralized Web 3.0.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Deliverables:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1: Architecture finalization [April] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2: Iterative buildout of prototype in a closed network and desktop browser only.
