At Key we work as compassionate partners with individuals, families, case managers and other professionals to provide the level of support needed to improve the lives of the clients we serve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Key Autism Services, all the autism treatment services we provide are guided by a common philosophy about the role of the family in a child's development.

Family is the ever-present guiding force in a child's life from the first breath through all the growing-up years. Family doesn't close for the holidays, go on vacation or call it quits at five o'clock. Family remains a persistent presence on a day-in, day-out basis, through all the seasons of the year, through all the years of childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team is committed to helping individuals and their families become self-sufficient and live as independently as their abilities allow. We hire compassionate, highly trained and dedicated individuals who show a passion to contribute their skills to make our client healthier and stronger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out more opportunities we have to offer! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;https://www.keyautismservices.com/careers/",FULL_TIME,Mental Health Care,41.568398,-87.61128,EducationalOccupationalCredential,associate degree,OccupationalExperienceRequirements,12,,,
