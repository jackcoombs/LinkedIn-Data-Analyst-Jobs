With it, developers and operators can build and manage their Kubernetes infrastructure, packages, and cloud workloads quickly and securely with a rich set of developer tooling. You will be integrated into the TAP on Public Clouds team where you'll get to work with cutting-edge cloud-native tooling and become an advocate for first-class integrations of TAP with public cloud providers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This is a unique opportunity to look more broadly at the TAP user experience to design and drive deeper integrations with native cloud provider services. Coupling the superior developer experience delivered via TAP with the scale and services of public clouds is strategically important and has the potential for a multiplicative effect on the value of TAP in the market.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This team - and VMware - recognize that every individual brings with them a unique set of knowledge, experiences, and potential. Our team offers an environment that is flexible and nurturing while helping each other hone our engineering craft.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this role, you will work to make TAP the preferred application platform across cloud providers. Tactically, our team is approaching this by enabling the easy deployment and consumption of TAP by integrating with public cloud marketplaces, and further identifying and integrating with cloud provider services customers would like to leverage via TAP. An example of this would be providing deep integration of TAP with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), ensuring that TAP fully integrates with it from an auth, security, and networking perspective.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Success in this role means you are establishing rapport with team members, participating in and honing the software delivery lifecycle process to ensure that we are focused on iteratively increasing the impact we have on consumption of TAP on the public cloud. In the first 6 months, you have made TAP easier to consume on public clouds by implementing a process for deploying infrastructure and installing TAP on all major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). In 12 months you have made the TAP experience better by enabling the consumption of native cloud provider services via tight integration with TAP. The further we integrate with cloud services, the more we will drive consumption of TAP on these providers&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing regularly?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive cross-team technical tasks by building relationships across the product portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 years or more of industry software development experience with enterprise software and/or cloud systems at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research and develop cutting edge cloud native software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in operations and software development with at least one cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) or an aptitude to pursue deep knowledge in one of these providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide feedback and coaching of peers through code and design reviews.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An advocate for agile software development methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write tests, tools, automation, and documentation aligned with our roadmap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide feedback throughout product management and engineering to improve Tanzu solutions’ user experience and highlight new areas of need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in customer briefings on technologies in the cloud native space providing insight and experience from Kubernetes users and VMware customers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain knowledge of platforms, architectures and the CNCF landscape with a deep understanding of Kubernetes and the Tanzu portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The hiring manager for this role is Aaron Meza, Senior Engineering Manager, Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) on Public Clouds. Aaron is passionate about building diverse, human-focused delivery teams with an emphasis on deliberate development - a belief that focusing on individual growth is not just a win for individuals but a win for business and customer outcomes as well. Aaron is passionate about making complex systems accessible and simple.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The TAP on Public Clouds team is relatively new. It is made up of individuals with diverse backgrounds who are excited about leveraging native cloud services to make the TAP experience seamless on our customer's preferred cloud provider.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What are the benefits and perks of working at VMware?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;You and your loved ones will be supported with a competitive and comprehensive benefits package.

With it, developers and operators can build and manage their Kubernetes infrastructure, packages, and cloud workloads quickly and securely with a rich set of developer tooling. You will be integrated into the TAP on Public Clouds team where you'll get to work with cutting-edge cloud-native tooling and become an advocate for first-class integrations of TAP with public cloud providers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This is a unique opportunity to look more broadly at the TAP user experience to design and drive deeper integrations with native cloud provider services. Coupling the superior developer experience delivered via TAP with the scale and services of public clouds is strategically important and has the potential for a multiplicative effect on the value of TAP in the market.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This team - and VMware - recognize that every individual brings with them a unique set of knowledge, experiences, and potential. Our team offers an environment that is flexible and nurturing while helping each other hone our engineering craft.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this role, you will work to make TAP the preferred application platform across cloud providers. Tactically, our team is approaching this by enabling the easy deployment and consumption of TAP by integrating with public cloud marketplaces, and further identifying and integrating with cloud provider services customers would like to leverage via TAP. An example of this would be providing deep integration of TAP with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), ensuring that TAP fully integrates with it from an auth, security, and networking perspective.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Success in this role means you are establishing rapport with team members, participating in and honing the software delivery lifecycle process to ensure that we are focused on iteratively increasing the impact we have on consumption of TAP on the public cloud. In the first 6 months, you have made TAP easier to consume on public clouds by implementing a process for deploying infrastructure and installing TAP on all major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). In 12 months you have made the TAP experience better by enabling the consumption of native cloud provider services via tight integration with TAP. The further we integrate with cloud services, the more we will drive consumption of TAP on these providers&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing regularly?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive cross-team technical tasks by building relationships across the product portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 years or more of industry software development experience with enterprise software and/or cloud systems at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research and develop cutting edge cloud native software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in operations and software development with at least one cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) or an aptitude to pursue deep knowledge in one of these providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide feedback and coaching of peers through code and design reviews.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An advocate for agile software development methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write tests, tools, automation, and documentation aligned with our roadmap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide feedback throughout product management and engineering to improve Tanzu solutions’ user experience and highlight new areas of need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in customer briefings on technologies in the cloud native space providing insight and experience from Kubernetes users and VMware customers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain knowledge of platforms, architectures and the CNCF landscape with a deep understanding of Kubernetes and the Tanzu portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The hiring manager for this role is Aaron Meza, Senior Engineering Manager, Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) on Public Clouds. Aaron is passionate about building diverse, human-focused delivery teams with an emphasis on deliberate development - a belief that focusing on individual growth is not just a win for individuals but a win for business and customer outcomes as well. Aaron is passionate about making complex systems accessible and simple.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The TAP on Public Clouds team is relatively new. It is made up of individuals with diverse backgrounds who are excited about leveraging native cloud services to make the TAP experience seamless on our customer's preferred cloud provider.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What are the benefits and perks of working at VMware?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;You and your loved ones will be supported with a competitive and comprehensive benefits package.
