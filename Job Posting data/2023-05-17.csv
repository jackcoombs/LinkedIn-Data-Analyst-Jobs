You will work with digital channel owners and media monitoring experts to help analyze performance and identify key learnings and provide recommendations that will propel the client forward. You will lead client-specific projects from data cleaning and aggregation to visual creation and finally to report completion as you analyze the results to create actionable insights that will guide strategic decisions, uncovering real-time optimization opportunities that impact the bottom line.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The candidate must be data agnostic, willing to leverage information from a bevy of sources to best analyze the problem and forge a solution. This person will build, develop and maintain data structures, reporting systems and build customized dashboards based on KPIs that will support key business decisions and shape future programming recommendations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This analytics team works in lockstep with the digital team at Zeno and will interact with every facet of the organization and, at times, clients as well. If you have an affinity for a wide gamut of data and are yearning to augment your knowledge, this role will allow you access to some of the most diverse datasets and tools around. That said, this person must be willing to get their hands dirty and roll up their sleeves in order to optimize existing processes, create best practices, work cross-functionally, ensure data validation, as well as build data visualizations from the ground up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;This Person Must&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Love to tinker:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What better way to learn than diving in and trying new tools or approaches to data and strategy? The more creative the solution, the better!&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Be a self-starter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Someone who loves taking challenges head-on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Love Technology&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt; An aptitude for and general interest in technology will go a long way to success in this role.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Think critically&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt; PR is difficult to measure in nature, we're looking for candidates that can think outside the box and are solution-oriented.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Learn, teach and collaborate&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This role is as much about teaching those around you as it is taking on challenges of your own.
