The tech team works in 3 different businesses: 1) Enterprise development, 2) contracting out developers to clients depending on needs, and 3) implementations and integration. Most projects they have are in React and .NET with SQL servers. Due to the consultancy work, having a more diverse tech stack is a plus. The compensation for this role given the experience is a little on the lower end, but they make up for it in Flex Hours which pays OT for all time worked over the standard 8 hours/day. 8 hours/day on a $100k salary comes out to $100k/year, but 9 hours/day is 112,500 annually and so on. If you're ambitious to grow your career by working more than 40 hours a week, this job is for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This role requires coming into the office 2 days a week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The candidate for this role must be a US citizen or Green Card holder.
