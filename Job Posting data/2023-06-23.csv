LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology is like retrofitting a brewery onto an emission source like a steel mill, but instead of using sugars and yeast to make beer, bacteria convert pollution to products! Imagine a day when you can power a plane by recycled carbon emissions, when your yoga pants or sneakers started life as pollution from a steel mill. This future is possible using LanzaTech technology. The first commercial facility is operating in China with Shougang converting steel mill emissions to ethanol. Additional commercial facilities are in development in Belgium with the world’s largest steel maker, ArcelorMittal, in India with Indian Oil using refinery offgases, in South Africa with Swayana, using ferroalloy offgases and using agricultural residues with ethanol producer, Aemetis in California. LanzaTech has already produced synthetic jet fuel from recycled carbon emissions and the world first flight using recycled carbon took place in October 2018 when Virgin Atlantic flew a Boeing 747 from Orlando, Florida to London, UK.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In 2019 LanzaTech was listed in FastCompany’s Top 50 Innovative Companies at #27 and #1 in the Energy Category. In 2018 and 2017, LanzaTech was recognized as the #1 Hottest company in the Advanced Bioeconomy by Biofuels Digest, the world’s most widely-read bioeconomy daily. In 2017 the company was also inaugurated into the Cleantech100 Hall of Fame, having been listed in the top 100 cleantech companies over the last 7 years. In 2016, the company won the Young Global Leader Award for Circular Economy at the World Economic Forum, LanzaTech was also the top biofuels company in the 2018 and 2016 CNBC Disruptor 50 Companies list. In 2015, LanzaTech was awarded the U.S. EPA Presidential Green Chemistry Award for Greener Synthetic Pathways. The company’s accomplishments were recognized through a number of prestigious awards in 2014, including the Guardian Sustainable Business Innovation Award for Carbon and Energy Management, Breakthrough Innovation Award at the Platts Global Metals Awards, and the Technical Development Award from the World Petroleum Council. In 2013, the company was named a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Position Summary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Global Services Engineer – A role with up to 90% travel, this position includes responsibility for all phases of process design work for commercial projects supporting our customers across various industries.

LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology is like retrofitting a brewery onto an emission source like a steel mill, but instead of using sugars and yeast to make beer, bacteria convert pollution to products! Imagine a day when you can power a plane by recycled carbon emissions, when your yoga pants or sneakers started life as pollution from a steel mill. This future is possible using LanzaTech technology. The first commercial facility is operating in China with Shougang converting steel mill emissions to ethanol. Additional commercial facilities are in development in Belgium with the world’s largest steel maker, ArcelorMittal, in India with Indian Oil using refinery offgases, in South Africa with Swayana, using ferroalloy offgases and using agricultural residues with ethanol producer, Aemetis in California. LanzaTech has already produced synthetic jet fuel from recycled carbon emissions and the world first flight using recycled carbon took place in October 2018 when Virgin Atlantic flew a Boeing 747 from Orlando, Florida to London, UK.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In 2019 LanzaTech was listed in FastCompany’s Top 50 Innovative Companies at #27 and #1 in the Energy Category. In 2018 and 2017, LanzaTech was recognized as the #1 Hottest company in the Advanced Bioeconomy by Biofuels Digest, the world’s most widely-read bioeconomy daily. In 2017 the company was also inaugurated into the Cleantech100 Hall of Fame, having been listed in the top 100 cleantech companies over the last 7 years. In 2016, the company won the Young Global Leader Award for Circular Economy at the World Economic Forum, LanzaTech was also the top biofuels company in the 2018 and 2016 CNBC Disruptor 50 Companies list. In 2015, LanzaTech was awarded the U.S. EPA Presidential Green Chemistry Award for Greener Synthetic Pathways. The company’s accomplishments were recognized through a number of prestigious awards in 2014, including the Guardian Sustainable Business Innovation Award for Carbon and Energy Management, Breakthrough Innovation Award at the Platts Global Metals Awards, and the Technical Development Award from the World Petroleum Council. In 2013, the company was named a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Position Summary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Global Services Engineer – A role with up to 90% travel, this position includes responsibility for all phases of process design work for commercial projects supporting our customers across various industries.

I've also placed 2 people with them and both have had fantastic feedback on the culture and opportunity. Their product is a blockchain ecosystem that will allow others to build out blockchain to their own application.
